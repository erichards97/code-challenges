general_solution calculates the fibonacci sequence upto the max value, then sums every 3rd element, starting from 2.

summing_solution avoids storing the whole sequence, instead summing the relevant numbers along the way.

Both solutions avoid repeating work by storing the last 2 fibonacci numbers in order to calculate the next one.
